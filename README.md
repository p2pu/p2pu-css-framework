# P2PU CSS framework

This is to help you get started with a project quickly that has a P2PU flavor to it. 

## Using the framework

The quickest way to get started is to use the CSS framework from the CDN. Add the following code to the head section of your web page.

```	
<link rel="stylesheet" href="p2pu-bootstrap-3/stylesheets/p2pustrap.css" media="screen">
```

And then add the following code to the end of your body section:

```
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script	src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.2.0/js/bootstrap.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://rawgithub.com/p2pu/p2pu_navigation_widget/master/p2pu_menu_slider.js"></script>
<script src="p2pu-bootstrap-3/javascripts/p2pustrap.js"></script>
```
